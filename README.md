## About

Smart_Bus is an application designed to enable intelligent management and tracking of bus systems. It comprises a frontend (built with Typescript, Vite, Tailwind, etc.) and a backend (Python) for handling data, APIs, routing, or whatever services you’ve built.

---

## Features

- Real‑time bus status and tracking  
- User interface with responsive design  
- Backend APIs for handling data operations  
- Linting, configuration, and environment settings for development workflow

| Frontend       | Typescript, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend        | Python                     |
| Tooling        | ESLint, PostCSS, Vite      |
| Configurations | Tailwind, tsconfig, etc.   |

## Architecture / Project Structure

Here’s a high‑level view of how things are organized:

```
Smart_Bus/
├── backend/                   # Python backend code (APIs, database models, etc.)
├── src/                       # Frontend source code
├── package.json              # Node dependencies, scripts
├── tsconfig.json             # Typescript configuration
├── tailwind.config.js        # Tailwind config
├── vite.config.ts            # Vite build / dev configuration
├── .gitignore
├── postcss.config.js
└── eslint.config.js
```

---

## Setup & Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (>= XX.X) & npm / yarn  
- Python (if backend has dependencies)  
- Git  

**Steps to get started:**

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pray1503/Smart_Bus.git
   cd Smart_Bus
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd (frontend folder if applicable, e.g. `.` or `src`)
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up backend (if applicable):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   # install python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure environment variables (see next section).

5. Run in development mode:

   ```bash
   # Frontend
   npm run dev

   # Backend
   (inside backend)
   python app.py  # or appropriate command
   ```

---

## Environment Variables

Add a `.env` file (or similar) in frontend/backend with values like:

```
# Example variables
API_URL= http://localhost:8000
PORT= 3000
# etc.
```

Make sure sensitive keys are not committed.

---

## Usage

Once running:

- Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you configured) for frontend.  
- Backend APIs available at e.g. `http://localhost:8000/api/...`.

---

## Running Tests / Lints

If you have linting/scripts:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Add tests commands if you have tests (e.g. `npm run test`).
